    "Imagine there is a stick 1 meter long. We drop n ants on this stick in random places (where n is not known beforehand). Ants travel along a stick at a speed of 1 cm/s. When they meet on their path, they will change direction (bounce off each other). Ants can fall from either side of the stick. How much time must elapse till we are sure all the ants will fall off the said stick?"
